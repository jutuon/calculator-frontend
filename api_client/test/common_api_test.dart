    // Connect to server using WebSocket after getting refresh and access tokens. Connection is required as API access is allowed for connected clients.  Send the current refersh token as Binary. The server will send the next refresh token (Binary) and after that the new access token (Text). After that API can be used.  The access token is valid until this WebSocket is closed.
